### Problem Statement
- There are 4 categories of cards in the given dataset : Blue, Silver, Gold, Platinum.
- Our goal is to predict  what kind of card a customer is likely to issue based on the information known about the customer
- The dataset contains 21 columns, including the dependent variable, which is the card category that we are trying to predict.
- The other 20 columns contains contains various information about the customer, based on which we will try to predict the type of card that a customer is likely to issue

---

- Since the dataset contains both the features and labels, this is a scenario where supervised machine learning algorithms can be used.

Project Status
24 Oct 2023
- The ML model has been built
Next, 
- I have to build a web app
- Then connect the model to the web app
